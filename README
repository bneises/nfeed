work in progress




INSTALL 
--------------
For now, all the install does is copy etc/nfeed to /etc/nfeed so there is
atleast a central configuration file.

Dependancies you must work out on your own:


Redis server version 2.0.4
----------
yum install redis
apt-get install redis-server



tornado python web framework and server
----------
easy_install tornado



USAGE:

with redis server running

create a cronjob for nfeed-cron

then
./nfeed-server
