work in progress




INSTALL 
--------------
For now, all the install does is copy etc/nfeed to /etc/nfeed so there is
atleast a central configuration file.


Dependancies you must work out on your own:


Redis server version 2.0.4
----------
yum install git
yum install redis
apt-get install redis-server
easy_install tornado
easy_install redis

git clone git://github.com/petekalo/nfeed.git
cd nfeed
./install.sh

CONFIGURE:
----------
After installation, edit /etc/nfeed/nfeed.conf

Make sure you update the installation directory/path, otherwise
nothing will work.


USAGE:
----------
With redis server running

create a cronjob for nfeed-cron, there is an example

then
./nfeed-server

init scripts to come
